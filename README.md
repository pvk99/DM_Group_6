Repository for the group project of Data Management - Group 6

Our e-commerce database project is for a UK-based online small-scale retail shop. We embark on a journey to design, translate, generate, control, and analyze, aiming to streamline our operations, enhance decision-making, and quantify our enterprise's performance.  
 
Firstly, we meticulously design an e-commerce workflow diagram (E-R diagram), capturing the essence of our online retail processes. From products to orders and transactions, we create a comprehensive blueprint that forms the backbone of our database structure. We then translate this blueprint into a functional SQL schema, laying the foundation for our database system.  
 
Utilizing R programming, we generate synthetic data tailored to our schema, reflecting real-world retail transactions while implementing robust quality checks to ensure data accuracy and reliability.  
Employing GitHub version control, we streamline project management, ensuring seamless collaboration and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.  
Lastly, we conduct advanced data analysis to measure our enterprise's performance quantitatively. Presenting our findings in non-technical terms, we empower stakeholders with actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making and foster business growth.
