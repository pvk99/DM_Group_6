Repository for the group project of Data Management - Group 6

Our e-commerce database project is for a UK-based online small-scale retail shop. We embark on a journey to design, translate, generate, control, and analyze, aiming to streamline our operations, enhance decision-making, and quantify our enterprise's performance.  

We begin by designing an e-commerce workflow diagram to map out our online retail processes, covering everything from products to orders and transactions. This blueprint serves as the foundation for our database structure, which we create using SQL.

Using R programming, we generate synthetic data tailored to our structure, ensuring it reflects real-world retail transactions and is accurate. We then employ GitHub for version control, facilitating seamless collaboration and accountability.

Finally, we conduct advanced data analysis to measure our enterprise's performance. Presenting our findings in non-technical terms, we empower stakeholders with actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making and foster business growth.
